# libaxolotl-windows
An implementation of the axolotl protocol, based on WhisperSystems/libaxolotl-java.

Depends on langboost/curve25519-uwp, Google Protocol Buffers, and Strilanc.May.

A very basic sample implementation can be found here:
https://github.com/langboost/axolotl-sample-client

The sample implementation simply proves the concept, and allows someone to step through the Axolotl protocol as it ratchets, encrypts, decrypts, etc.
